# NanoSwarm architecture

## Design boundary

The simulation is authoritative. The browser renders state and sends commands; it does not award resources, finish timers, or alter inventories directly.

## Exact matter

Feedstock and Residuum are inventories of constituent atoms. The simulation knows the underlying composition, while the interface may hide unidentified constituents. This conserves matter without floating-point percentages or a mutable generic-mass currency.

## Cohorts

A cohort is a group of identical nanites that began the same job at the same time under the same recipe revision. A million workers therefore remain a real million discrete workers without requiring a million independently updated timers.

Inputs are removed from available inventory when a cohort starts. Its payload is stored on the cohort and applied at completion. This prevents two cohorts from spending the same atoms and makes save/load deterministic.

## Time and offline progress

`advanceSimulation` moves between the next cohort completion, the next research completion, and the requested target time. It does not replay display frames. Leaving the game open and loading it later must produce identical state.

## Research

Research jobs consume their material cost when queued. Work is measured in nanite-milliseconds. The embedded computronium supplies the greater of 100 nanite-equivalents or 1% of the total swarm; explicitly allocated research nanites add to that capacity.

## Scale path

Resource and worker counts use `bigint`. Wall-clock timestamps are integer milliseconds. Future efficiency values should use fixed-point basis points rather than floating-point state. Cohorts may later include recipe revisions, targets, and failure modes without changing the event model.
